## DIYRSS

DIY RSS fills a gap in the web: a low-cost way to check websites for updates.

We used to have RSS feeds on most major sites. However as everyone starts moving towards platforms, SSO, and other technologies, RSS fell behind in priorities.

My proposed solution is a crowd-contirbuted monitoring application that will monitor and notify users when updates are posted. 

To start, it will be fairly simple. As time goes on, I hope to implement site-specific tuning that improves the quality of the results.
